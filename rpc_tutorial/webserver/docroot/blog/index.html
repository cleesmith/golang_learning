  <p>
    A property of universal computation—Turing completeness—is that a computer program can write a computer program.


    This is a powerful idea that is not appreciated as often as it might be, even though it happens frequently.


    It&#39;s a big part of the definition of a compiler, for instance.


    It&#39;s also how the <code>go</code> <code>test</code> command works: it scans the packages to be tested,


    writes out a Go program containing a test harness customized for the package,


    and then compiles and runs it.


    Modern computers are so fast this expensive-sounding sequence can complete in a fraction of a second.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    There are lots of other examples of programs that write programs.


    <a href="http://golang.org/cmd/yacc/" target="_blank">Yacc</a>, for instance, reads in a description of a grammar and writes out a program to parse that grammar.


    The protocol buffer &#34;compiler&#34; reads an interface description and emits structure definitions,


    methods, and other support code.


    Configuration tools of all sorts work like this too, examining metadata or the environment


    and emitting scaffolding customized to the local state.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    Programs that write programs are therefore important elements in software engineering,


    but programs like Yacc that produce source code need to be integrated into the build


    process so their output can be compiled.


    When an external build tool like Make is being used, this is usually easy to do.


    But in Go, whose go tool gets all necessary build information from the Go source, there is a problem.


    There is simply no mechanism to run Yacc from the go tool alone.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    Until now, that is.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    The <a href="http://blog.golang.org/go1.4" target="_blank">latest Go release</a>, 1.4,


    includes a new command that makes it easier to run such tools.


    It&#39;s called <code>go</code> <code>generate</code>, and it works by scanning for special comments in Go source code


    that identify general commands to run.


    It&#39;s important to understand that <code>go</code> <code>generate</code> is not part of <code>go</code> <code>build</code>.


    It contains no dependency analysis and must be run explicitly before running <code>go</code> <code>build</code>.


    It is intended to be used by the author of the Go package, not its clients.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    The <code>go</code> <code>generate</code> command is easy to use.


    As a warmup, here&#39;s how to use it to generate a Yacc grammar.


    Say you have a Yacc input file called <code>gopher.y</code> that defines a grammar for your new language.


    To produce the Go source file implementing the grammar,


    you would normally invoke the standard Go version of Yacc like this:
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <div class="code"><pre>go tool yacc -o gopher.go -p parser gopher.y</pre></div>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    The <code>-o</code> option names the output file while <code>-p</code> specifies the package name.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    To have <code>go</code> <code>generate</code> drive the process, in any one of the regular (non-generated) <code>.go</code> files


    in the same directory, add this comment anywhere in the file:
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <div class="code"><pre>//go:generate go tool yacc -o gopher.go -p parser gopher.y</pre></div>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    This text is just the command above prefixed by a special comment recognized by <code>go</code> <code>generate</code>.


    The comment must start at the beginning of the line and have no spaces between the <code>//</code> and the <code>go:generate</code>.


    After that marker, the rest of the line specifies a command for <code>go</code> <code>generate</code> to run.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    Now run it. Change to the source directory and run <code>go</code> <code>generate</code>, then <code>go</code> <code>build</code> and so on:
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <div class="code"><pre>$ cd $GOPATH/myrepo/gopher
$ go generate
$ go build
$ go test</pre></div>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    That&#39;s it.


    Assuming there are no errors, the <code>go</code> <code>generate</code> command will invoke <code>yacc</code> to create <code>gopher.go</code>,


    at which point the directory holds the full set of Go source files, so we can build, test, and work normally.


    Every time <code>gopher.y</code> is modified, just rerun <code>go</code> <code>generate</code> to regenerate the parser.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    For more details about how <code>go</code> <code>generate</code> works, including options, environment variables,


    and so on, see the <a href="http://golang.org/s/go1.4-generate" target="_blank">design document</a>.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    Go generate does nothing that couldn&#39;t be done with Make or some other build mechanism,


    but it comes with the <code>go</code> tool—no extra installation required—and fits nicely into the Go ecosystem.


    Just keep in mind that it is for package authors, not clients,


    if only for the reason that the program it invokes might not be available on the target machine.


    Also, if the containing package is intended for import by <code>go</code> <code>get</code>,


    once the file is generated (and tested!) it must be checked into the


    source code repository to be available to clients.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    Now that we have it, let&#39;s use it for something new.


    As a very different example of how <code>go</code> <code>generate</code> can help, there is a new program available in the


    <code>golang.org/x/tools</code> repository called <code>stringer</code>.


    It automatically writes string methods for sets of integer constants.


    It&#39;s not part of the released distribution, but it&#39;s easy to install:
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <div class="code"><pre>$ go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stringer</pre></div>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    Here&#39;s an example from the documentation for


    <a href="http://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stringer" target="_blank"><code>stringer</code></a>.


    Imagine we have some code that contains a set of integer constants defining different types of pills:
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <div class="code"><pre>package painkiller

type Pill int

const (
    Placebo Pill = iota
    Aspirin
    Ibuprofen
    Paracetamol
    Acetaminophen = Paracetamol
)</pre></div>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    For debugging, we&#39;d like these constants to pretty-print themselves, which means we want a method with signature,
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <div class="code"><pre>func (p Pill) String() string</pre></div>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    It&#39;s easy to write one by hand, perhaps like this:
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <div class="code"><pre>func (p Pill) String() string {
    switch p {
    case Placebo:
        return &#34;Placebo&#34;
    case Aspirin:
        return &#34;Aspirin&#34;
    case Ibuprofen:
        return &#34;Ibuprofen&#34;
    case Paracetamol: // == Acetaminophen
        return &#34;Paracetamol&#34;
    }
    return fmt.Sprintf(&#34;Pill(%d)&#34;, p)
}</pre></div>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    There are other ways to write this function, of course.


    We could use a slice of strings indexed by Pill, or a map, or some other technique.


    Whatever we do, we need to maintain it if we change the set of pills, and we need to make sure it&#39;s correct.


    (The two names for paracetamol make this trickier than it might otherwise be.)


    Plus the very question of which approach to take depends on the types and values:


    signed or unsigned, dense or sparse, zero-based or not, and so on.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    The <code>stringer</code> program takes care of all these details.


    Although it can be run in isolation, it is intended to be driven by <code>go</code> <code>generate</code>.


    To use it, add a generate comment to the source, perhaps near the type definition:
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <div class="code"><pre>//go:generate stringer -type=Pill</pre></div>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    This rule specifies that <code>go</code> <code>generate</code> should run the <code>stringer</code> tool to generate a <code>String</code> method for type <code>Pill</code>.


    The output is automatically written to <code>pill_string.go</code> (a default we could override with the


    <code>-output</code> flag).
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    Let&#39;s run it:
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <div class="code"><pre>$ go generate
$ cat pill_string.go
// generated by stringer -type Pill pill.go; DO NOT EDIT

package pill

import &#34;fmt&#34;

const _Pill_name = &#34;PlaceboAspirinIbuprofenParacetamol&#34;

var _Pill_index = [...]uint8{0, 7, 14, 23, 34}

func (i Pill) String() string {
    if i &lt; 0 || i&#43;1 &gt;= Pill(len(_Pill_index)) {
        return fmt.Sprintf(&#34;Pill(%d)&#34;, i)
    }
    return _Pill_name[_Pill_index[i]:_Pill_index[i&#43;1]]
}
$</pre></div>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    Every time we change the definition of <code>Pill</code> or the constants, all we need to do is run
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <div class="code"><pre>$ go generate</pre></div>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    to update the <code>String</code> method.


    And of course if we&#39;ve got multiple types set up this way in the same package,


    that single command will update all their <code>String</code> methods with a single command.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    There&#39;s no question the generated method is ugly.


    That&#39;s OK, though, because humans don&#39;t need to work on it; machine-generated code is often ugly.


    It&#39;s working hard to be efficient.


    All the names are smashed together into a single string,


    which saves memory (only one string header for all the names, even if there are zillions of them).


    Then an array, <code>_Pill_index</code>, maps from value to name by a simple, efficient technique.


    Note too that <code>_Pill_index</code> is an array (not a slice; one more header eliminated) of <code>uint8</code>,


    the smallest integer sufficient to span the space of values.


    If there were more values, or there were negatives ones,


    the generated type of <code>_Pill_index</code> might change to <code>uint16</code> or <code>int8</code>: whatever works best.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    The approach used by the methods printed by <code>stringer</code> varies according to the properties of the constant set.


    For instance, if the constants are sparse, it might use a map.


    Here&#39;s a trivial example based on a constant set representing powers of two:
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <div class="code"><pre>const _Power_name = &#34;p0p1p2p3p4p5...&#34;

var _Power_map = map[Power]string{
    1:    _Power_name[0:2],
    2:    _Power_name[2:4],
    4:    _Power_name[4:6],
    8:    _Power_name[6:8],
    16:   _Power_name[8:10],
    32:   _Power_name[10:12],
    ...,

    In short, generating the method automatically allows us to do a better job than we would expect a human to do.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    There are lots of other uses of <code>go</code> <code>generate</code> already installed in the Go tree.


    Examples include generating Unicode tables in the <code>unicode</code> package,


    creating efficient methods for encoding and decoding arrays in <code>encoding/gob</code>,


    producing time zone data in the <code>time</code> package, and so on.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    Please use <code>go</code> <code>generate</code> creatively.


    It&#39;s there to encourage experimentation.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    And even if you don&#39;t, use the new <code>stringer</code> tool to write your <code>String</code> methods for your integer constants.


    Let the machine do the work.

		<h3 class="title"><a href="/go1.4">Go 1.4 is released</a></h3>
		<p class="date">10 December 2014</p>
		

  
  
    
      
        
  
  <p>
    Today we announce Go 1.4, the fifth major stable release of Go, arriving six


    months after our previous major release <a href="https://blog.golang.org/go1.3" target="_blank">Go 1.3</a>.


    It contains a small language change, support for more operating systems


    and processor architectures, and improvements to the tool chain and libraries.


    As always, Go 1.4 keeps the promise of compatibility, and almost everything


    will continue to compile and run without change when moved to 1.4.


    For the full details, see the <a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1.4" target="_blank">Go 1.4 release notes</a>.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    The most notable new feature in this release is official support for Android.


    Using the support in the core and the libraries in the


    <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/mobile" target="_blank">golang.org/x/mobile</a> repository,


    it is now possible to write simple Android apps using only Go code.


    At this stage, the support libraries are still nascent and under heavy development.


    Early adopters should expect a bumpy ride, but we welcome the community to get involved.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    The language change is a tweak to the syntax of for-range loops.


    You may now write &#34;for range s {&#34; to loop over each item from s,


    without having to assign the value, loop index, or map key.


    See the <a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1.4#forrange" target="_blank">release notes</a> for details.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    The go command has a new subcommand, go generate, to automate the running of


    tools to generate source code before compilation.


    For example, it can be used to automate the generation of String methods for


    typed constants using the


    <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stringer/" target="_blank">new stringer tool</a>.


    For more information, see the <a href="https://golang.org/s/go1.4-generate" target="_blank">design document</a>.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    Most programs will run about the same speed or slightly faster in 1.4 than in


    1.3; some will be slightly slower.


    There are many changes, making it hard to be precise about what to expect.


    See the <a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1.4#performance" target="_blank">release notes</a> for more discussion.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    And, of course, there are many more improvements and bug fixes.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    In case you missed it, a few weeks ago the sub-repositories were moved to new locations.


    For example, the go.tools packages are now imported from &#34;golang.org/x/tools&#34;.


    See the <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-announce/eD8dh3T9yyA/HDOEU_ZSmvAJ" target="_blank">announcement post</a> for details.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    This release also coincides with the project&#39;s move from Mercurial to Git (for


    source control), Rietveld to Gerrit (for code review), and Google Code to


    Github (for issue tracking and wiki).


    The move affects the core Go repository and its sub-repositories.


    You can find the canonical Git repositories at


    <a href="https://go.googlesource.com" target="_blank">go.googlesource.com</a>,


    and the issue tracker and wiki at the


    <a href="https://github.com/golang/go" target="_blank">golang/go GitHub repo</a>.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    While development has already moved over to the new infrastructure,


    for the 1.4 release we still recommend that users who


    <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install/source" target="_blank">install from source</a>


    use the Mercurial repositories.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    For App Engine users, Go 1.4 is now available for beta testing.


    See <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/google-appengine-go/ndtQokV3oFo/25wV1W9JtywJ" target="_blank">the announcement</a> for details.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    From all of us on the Go team, please enjoy Go 1.4, and have a happy holiday season.
  </p>

  <p>
    Five years ago we launched the Go project. It seems like only yesterday that we


    were preparing the initial public release: our


    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091112094121/http://golang.org/" target="_blank">website</a> was


    a lovely shade of yellow, we were calling Go a &#34;systems language&#34;, and you had


    to terminate statements with a semicolon and write Makefiles to build your


    code. We had no idea how Go would be received. Would people share our vision


    and goals? Would people find Go useful?
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    At launch, there was a flurry of attention. Google had produced a new


    programming language, and everyone was eager to check it out. Some programmers


    were turned off by Go&#39;s conservative feature set—at first glance they saw


    &#34;nothing to see here&#34;—but a smaller group saw the beginnings of an ecosystem


    tailored to their needs as working software engineers. These few would form the


    kernel of the Go community.
  </p>

  <p>
    After the initial release, it took us a while to properly communicate the


    goals and design ethos behind Go. Rob Pike did so eloquently in his 2012 essay


    <a href="http://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article" target="_blank"><i>Go at Google: Language Design in the Service of Software Engineering</i></a> and


    more personally in his blog post


    <a href="http://commandcenter.blogspot.com.au/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html" target="_blank"><i>Less is exponentially more</i></a>.


    Andrew Gerrand&#39;s


    <a href="http://vimeo.com/53221560" target="_blank"><i>Code that grows with grace</i></a>


    (<a href="http://talks.golang.org/2012/chat.slide" target="_blank">slides</a>) and


    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKGmK_Z1Zl0" target="_blank"><i>Go for Gophers</i></a>


    (<a href="http://talks.golang.org/2014/go4gophers.slide" target="_blank">slides</a>) give a


    more in-depth, technical take on Go&#39;s design philosophy.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    Over time, the few became many. The turning point for the project was the


    release of Go 1 in March 2012, which provided a stable language and standard


    library that developers could trust. By 2014, the project had hundreds of core


    contributors, the ecosystem had countless <a href="https://godoc.org/" target="_blank">libraries and tools</a>


    maintained by thousands of developers, and the greater community had


    many passionate members (or, as we call them, &#34;gophers&#34;). Today, by our current


    metrics, the Go community is growing faster than we believed possible.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    Where can those gophers be found? They are at the many Go events that are


    popping up around the world. This year we saw several dedicated Go conferences:


    the inaugural <a href="http://blog.golang.org/gophercon" target="_blank">GopherCon</a> and


    <a href="http://www.dotgo.eu/" target="_blank">dotGo</a> conferences in Denver and Paris, the


    <a href="http://blog.golang.org/fosdem14" target="_blank">Go DevRoom at FOSDEM</a> and two more


    instances of the biannual <a href="https://github.com/GoCon/GoCon" target="_blank">GoCon</a> conference


    in Tokyo. At each event, gophers from around the globe eagerly presented their


    Go projects. For the Go team, it is very satisfying to meet so many programmers


    that share our vision and excitement.

  <p>
    <i>More than 1,200 gophers attended GopherCon in Denver and dotGo in Paris.</i>
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    There are also dozens of community-run


    <a href="http://golang.org/wiki/GoUserGroups" target="_blank">Go User Groups</a> spread across cities


    worldwide. If you haven&#39;t visited your local group, consider going along. And


    if there isn&#39;t a group in your area, maybe you should


    <a href="https://blog.golang.org/getthee-to-go-meetup" target="_blank">start one</a>?
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    Today, Go has found a home in the cloud. Go arrived as the industry underwent a


    tectonic shift toward cloud computing, and we were thrilled to see it quickly


    become an important part of that movement. Its simplicity, efficiency, built-in


    concurrency primitives, and modern standard library make it a great fit for


    cloud software development (after all, that&#39;s what it was designed for).


    Significant open source cloud projects like


    <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a> and


    <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a> have been


    written in Go, and infrastructure companies like Google, CloudFlare, Canonical,


    Digital Ocean, GitHub, Heroku, and Microsoft are now using Go to do some heavy


    lifting.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    So, what does the future hold? We think that 2015 will be Go&#39;s biggest year yet.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    Go 1.4—in addition to its <a href="http://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.4" target="_blank">new features and fixes</a>—lays


    the groundwork for a new low-latency garbage collector and support for running


    Go on mobile devices. It is due to be released on December 1st 2014.


    We expect the new GC to be available in Go 1.5, due June 1st 2015, which will


    make Go appealing for a broader range of applications.


    We can&#39;t wait to see where people take it.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    And there will be more great events, with <a href="http://gothamgo.com/" target="_blank">GothamGo</a> in


    New York (15 Nov), another Go DevRoom at FOSDEM in Brussels (Jan 31 and Feb 1;


    <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/1xgBazQzs1I/hwrZ5ni8cTEJ" target="_blank">get involved!</a>),


    <a href="http://www.gophercon.in/" target="_blank">GopherCon India</a> in Bengaluru (19-21 Feb),


    the original <a href="http://gophercon.com/" target="_blank">GopherCon</a> back at Denver in July, and


    <a href="http://www.dotgo.eu/" target="_blank">dotGo</a> on again at Paris in November.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    The Go team would like to extend its thanks to all the gophers out there.


    Here&#39;s to the next five years.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    <i>To celebrate 5 years of Go, over the coming month the</i>


    <a href="http://blog.gopheracademy.com/" target="_blank"><i>Gopher Academy</i></a>


    <i>will publish a series of articles by prominent Go users. Be sure to check out</i>
